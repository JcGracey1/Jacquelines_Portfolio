					<h2 class="center-text">About Me</h2>
					<p> Hello, I'm Jacqueline Gracey—a game designer driven by the challenge of transforming intricate problems into captivating gaming experiences. Currently in my final year pursuing a Bachelor’s
						in Computer Science: Game Design at UC Santa Cruz, I have developed strong skills in C++, Java, and JavaScript, focusing on creating interactive and immersive games. My portfolio features
						innovative projects like ‘Starcatto’ and ‘Protest Pacer,’ where I've demonstrated my ability to blend technical skill with creative game mechanics. Beyond coding, I stay active with workouts
						and team sports, which enhance my focus and collaborative spirit—traits I bring to every project. Eager to contribute to pioneering gaming projects, I am on the lookout for opportunities
						that challenge traditional gameplay and align with my passion for game development.

                </ul>
				<p> This project promotes the exploration of audio and visuals in a 
					space themed canvas. Connect different stars to explore new combinations of
					sounds. Press on a planet to add a drum beat.

				</ul>
				<p> Protest pacer was my first game project completed at UCSC. It is a reimagining of 
					Snake; functions added include blocking a car will give the player more points, or
					using the space bar as a speed boost.

				</ul>
				<p> Good Boy VP is virtual pet the utilizes OpenAI in order to react to text commands given by the user
					as well as an HFSM to dictate the different states the the dog can fall in and out of, depending
					on the care given to it by the user. I focused on designing the HFSM, which indicated various different
					states the dog can be in and the transitions between them.

				<p> Revolution Cows rework is a refactored version of a previous game project. I refactored to align with
					good programming principles and adjusted logic to make the play infinite.
