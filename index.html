					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p> Hello, I'm Jacqueline Gracey—a game designer driven by the challenge of transforming intricate problems into captivating gaming experiences. Currently in my final year pursuing a Bachelor’s
						in Computer Science: Game Design at UC Santa Cruz, I have developed strong skills in C++, Java, and JavaScript, focusing on creating interactive and immersive games. My portfolio features
						innovative projects like ‘Starcatto’ and ‘Protest Pacer,’ where I've demonstrated my ability to blend technical skill with creative game mechanics. Beyond coding, I stay active with workouts
						and team sports, which enhance my focus and collaborative spirit—traits I bring to every project. Eager to contribute to pioneering gaming projects, I am on the lookout for opportunities
						that challenge traditional gameplay and align with my passion for game development.

					<li><a href="./project1/index.html">Starcatto</a></li>
                </ul>
				<p> This project promotes the exploration of audio and visuals in a 
					space themed canvas. Connect different stars to explore new combinations of
					sounds. Press on a planet to add a drum beat.

					<li><a href="https://jcgracey.itch.io/protest-pacer">Protest Pacer</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p> Protest pacer was my first game project completed at UCSC. It is a reimagining of 
					Snake; functions added include blocking a car will give the player more points, or
					using the space bar as a speed boost.
